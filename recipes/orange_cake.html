    <p>A simple, but marvelous orange cake. The cake itself is a four-layered genoise sponge cake.</p>
    <p>The cream is a swiss meringue buttercream which gives the cake a silky smooth and light feel.
        Orange is infused through the cake by incorporating zest into the cake sheet and an orange puree made
        from fresh oranges.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a bowl of eggs in a pot of hot water, add sugar and vanilla extract, and stir to raise the temperature
            to about 40 degrees.</li>
        <li>Take out the bowl with the egg and place the bowl with butter on the pot to raise the temperature (about 50
            to 60 degrees).</li>
        <li>Whip the eggs in the order of high speed, medium speed, and low speed to make a dense foam.</li>
        <li>Divide the wheat flour and baking powder into 2 parts and sieve them. Mix until raw flour is no longer
            visible.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice to warm milk (about 50 degrees) and mix, then add to the dough and mix.</li>
        <li>Add a part of the dough to the butter melted in a hot water bath and mix, then put it back into the dough
            and mix evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the dough into the oven pan, add the orange pigment to the remaining dough, mix, and pour into
            another oven pan.</li>
        <li>(If you add color to the dough and mix it, the volume will decrease, so it is better if you leave a little
            more of the dough with the color in it)</li>
        <li> Beat to remove large air bubbles, bake in an oven at 170 degrees (preheated to 190 degrees) for about 40
            minutes, take it out, turn it over, and cool.</li>
        <li> Separate only the orange flesh put it in a saucepan, add sugar, and simmer until thickened (over low heat
            for at least 10 minutes).</li>
        <li> Add lemon juice and boil a little more, then cool it in the refrigerator and put it in a piping bag.</li>
        <li> Mix the egg whites with sugar and salt, then place them in a pot of boiling water and boil it to 70 degrees
            while stirring.</li>
        <li> Remove from the pot and whip to make a hard meringue. (Cool the meringue to about 30 degrees)</li>
        <li> Add one or two pieces of room temperature butter at a time and whip enough. Lastly, add orange Cointreau
            and whip a little more.</li>
        <li> Remove the top and bottom sides of the cake sheet and cut it into 2 pieces to prepare a total of 4 sheets.
        </li>
        (I removed the burn color from the edge of the sheet and used it, but it's okay to use it as is)</li>
        <li> Put a little cream for decoration on the top, put an orange sheet on a spinning wheel, and sprinkle syrup.
        </li>
        <li> Flatten with cream, top with orange puree, flatten, place the vanilla sheet on top, and repeat.</li>
        <li> After icing with buttercream, harden in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add color to the remaining cream to make orange cream, and apply to the cake and icing.</li>
        <li> Squeeze the white cream on the top using a tip (No. 865, round tip) and put it in the refrigerator for
            about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dig out the top of the cream squeezed with a round tip, make a groove, and put the orange puree.</li>
